# Running

I like to run... or maybe I like to jog. It doesn't really matter.  I like move a little faster than walking.

## My Goals

When I run I just move. I don't really think about what my goals are. I guess I try to be fast. I think this is wrong.  What would I rather focus on? 

1. Breathing
2. Avoiding injury
3. Remaining balanced
4. Adapting to the terrain

### Breathing

I hold my breath when I run. I actually do it all of the time. I need to train myself to breathe more fluidly.  How? I do not know yet. 

### Avoiding Injury

I want to avoid injuring myself by trying to move in ways that my body is not capable of. Today I felt my ankle take too much impact. I drop the left side of my body when I run. I must focus on keeping balance and moving without injury.

### Remaining Balanced

I think if am able to alow my body to balance out I will be able to breathe and avoid injury and adapt to the terrain.. Breathing well requires that I meet all of the prerequisite conditions.. which of course are balance, proper movement, and adaptability.

### Adapting to The Terrain

Like everything in life I must adapt to my environment. It is irrational to act in a way that is contrary to reality.
